Well, you can replace it.. replace with nothing.\n\nNo one can know what Hair Force One is doing. To proceed, either write \"Hair Force One\" or \"landed\" in \"regex expression\" field. That way, it will remain a mystery.", "Houston, we have a problem! We are sharing too much personal data with our enginners. Your mission is to remove all names, only keep the numbers.\n\nThat seems hard. With one expression? Yep! Type \"\\w*:\" into the \"regex expression\" field and see the magic happen.\n\n \"\\w\" means any word (letter), \"*\" means from 0 occurences to infinity, and the \":\" because it is not considered a word."]

This is heavily used in scripts, programming languages and text editors.\n\nRemember this next time you type Command+F.",
